Main Game View: This will be the top 80% of the screen where the scene backgrounds are displayed.
Bottom UI Bar: A dedicated bar at the bottom of the screen.
Character Stat Display: A small, themed area showing the current POV character's stats (e.g., a glittery meter for HD's "Fabulousness," a crackling energy bar for Rizzler's "Kenergy").
Inventory Slots: A scrolling bar or a series of boxes to hold item icons like the Barbie Doll.
Menu Button: A stylized gear or "Start" button that brings up the Save/Load/New Game menu.
Dialogue Box: A classic dialogue box that appears at the bottom, featuring:
Character Portrait Area: A space on the left for the speaking character's portrait.
Text Area: A large area for the dialogue text.
Choice Buttons: When a choice is presented, large, colorful, and satisfyingly clickable buttons will appear over the dialogue box.
Custom Cursor: A unique cursor, perhaps a sparkling hyena paw print or a glitching cosmic symbol, that changes when hovering over interactive "hotspots."
2. Character Assets
These are the stars of the show. We need sprites for dialogue and for animating within the scenes.
Dialogue Portraits: For each of the 4 main characters (HD, Nabu, Rizzler, Sypher), we need a set of high-resolution portraits showing different emotions:
Neutral / Default
Happy / Smug / Mischievous
Angry / Determined
Sad / Confused
Shocked / Surprised
In-Scene Sprites & Animations: Full-body, cartoon-style sprites for each character that can be placed in the scene backgrounds. These will need basic animations:
Idle Animation: A simple breathing or shifting animation for when they're standing still.
Walk Cycle: A looping animation for moving across the screen.
Special Action Animations:
HD: Striking a dramatic pose, pulling out her fake mustache, laughing (Hoo-hoo-HOO!).
Nabu: A dramatic gesture for banishing Rizzlord, sipping from her cosmic drink.
Rizzler: A "truth bomb" finger point, looking panicked, a "rizz" grin.
Sypher: A shimmering/glitching effect to show its digital nature.
3. Scene Backgrounds
These are the static, hand-painted style backgrounds that define the world. Each one will be a screen the player can explore, with clickable hotspots.
Masai Mara (Opening): The vibrant, whimsical scene from the first image. Hotspots could include the jeep, the lion, and the bushes.
Tourist Camp: A messy picnic blanket scene where HD convinces the little girl to take her. Hotspots: the girl, the sandwich, the carry-on bag.
Chicago Streets: A chaotic city street for the chase scene. Think exaggerated perspectives, food carts, and funny details in the background.
The Glenwood (Main Hub): This is your "Moe's Tavern." It needs to feel both grimy and magical. We'll need a few views:
Main Floor view (showing the stage, tables, and the bar).
Backstage view (Nabu's mysterious lounge area).
Rogers Park Antique Shop: A cozy, cluttered shop filled with curiosities. The central focus will be the glass display case with the Bild Lili doll.
Bild Lili's Cartoon World: A surreal, black-and-white (with pops of color) world designed to look like a 1950s German comic strip.
4. Item & Inventory Assets
These are the objects the player can pick up and use. We'll need two versions: one for the in-scene world and a smaller icon for the inventory bar.
The Barbie Doll: The catalyst for the whole story.
The Bild Lili Doll: The "Holy Grail." It should look distinct and important.
HD's Fake Mustache: A classic prop.
Nabu's Cosmic Drink: A swirling, mysterious beverage in a strange chalice.
The Tinfoil Hat: Worn by the rabble-rouser at The Glenwood.
Rizzlord's Phone: His tool for going live and spinning the narrative.
5. Special Cutscene & Event Assets
These are full-screen images or special animated elements for key story beats that go beyond the normal gameplay view.
"TO CATCH A PREDATOR" Neon Sign: A flickering, dramatic graphic.
The "RIZZ-O-METER": A wacky, oversized contraption with bouncing needles and flashing lights.
GFW Alert Graphic: A glitchy, futuristic pop-up that interrupts the screen.
Barbie's Cosmic Hologram: An ethereal, glowing, full-screen image of Barbie delivering her message.
The Rizzlord Alderman Poster: A cheesy, terribly designed political campaign poster.

16-Bit Point & Click: The entire scene is rendered in classic pixel art, with careful dithering to create gradients and textures. The perspective is a static, wide shot, perfect for a point-and-click adventure game screen.
GeoCities / Lofi: The checkerboard floor is a direct callback to early web design and tiling backgrounds. The patterns on the back wall feel like something you'd find on a MIDI-blasting Angelfire page. The whole vibe is low-fidelity but intentionally stylized.
DMT / Cosmic: The impossible architecture, the glowing celestial light, the swirling nebulae visible through the "windows," and the shimmering, otherworldly colors give it that psychedelic, reality-bending quality. The stage isn't just lit; it's being bathed in cosmic energy.
Barbie Aesthetic: The color palette is pure Barbie Dreamhouse on a cosmic trip. The hyper-pinks, iridescent purples, and shimmering teals create an atmosphere that is unapologetically fabulous and glamorous, yet deeply strange.
Potential Hotspots for Gameplay:
The Stage: Clicking here would be the trigger for a character to begin their performance.
The Microphone: Could be examined for a funny description ("It smells faintly of ozone, desperation, and bubblegum.")
The Bar: A place to talk to an NPC or find a quest item (like Nabu's cosmic drink).
The Tables: You could click on them to get observations about the weirdos who usually sit there.
The Swirling Portal "Windows": Examining these could provide cryptic lore about the Galactic Federation or Nabu's origins.
