[Scene opens with a whimsical marching band tune. A sweeping shot of the Masai Mara,
vibrant colors everywhere, with a cartoonish sun high in the sky. A safari jeep bounces
across the terrain like it's on springs, with tourists laughing and pointing, totally
oblivious to the chaos about to unfold.]
TOURIST #1 (wearing a ridiculous sunhat, practically leaning out of the jeep): I say, look
at all the exotic animals, dear! Lions, giraffes, and—wait a second! What is that!?
[Cut to a lion dramatically leaping out of the bushes, roaring like a vaudeville
performer. The tourists shriek in terror and the Barbie doll goes flying through the air
in slow motion, twirling like it's in a beauty pageant.]
NARRATOR (as if narrating an epic battle scene, with dramatic, cartoonish music): And
then— POOF—a lost Barbie doll, flung from the heavens like a cosmic comet, destined to
find its new owner…*
[Enter Baby HD (Hyena Diva), running around like a toddler on a sugar high, paws
outstretched, sniffing the air like a detective in a noir film. She stops dead in her tracks
as the doll falls to the ground with a whoosh sound effect.]
HD (grinning mischievously, rubbing her paws together like a tiny, silent Harpo Marx—
wide-eyed, with an exaggerated twinkle in her eyes): What’s this, I wonder?
[She picks up the Barbie doll dramatically, holding it like she’s found the Holy Grail,
with sparkles and stars flying around her. Cue a whoosh sound effect as her fur shines
brighter than the sun. HD then begins to do an over-the-top, slow-motion pose, flipping
the doll in the air and striking a runway stance.]
NARRATOR (in a Groucho Marx voice, as if to a live studio audience): And just like that,
our dear Hyena Diva—soon to be the QUEEN of the Savannah—discovered what the rest of
us could only dream of. FABULOUSNESS! PURE, UNADULTERATED FABULOUSNESS!
[Cut to a vibrantly animated close-up of HD’s face, eyes wide in revelation.]
HD (giving a silent “clap” as if saying, “A-ha!” with exaggerated expression): (Mimes an
over-the-top gasp and starts twirling around with Barbie in hand like she’s in a beauty
pageant competition, throwing invisible confetti as she does.)
NARRATOR (Groucho-esque, over-dramatic): So there she was, discovering the mystical
power of the plastic queen—this was no ordinary toy, no, no, no—this was the ultimate
symbol of divinity. Barbie wasn’t just a doll. She was a lifestyle!
[Flash forward to HD being surrounded by a group of safari matriarchs—oversized,
grumpy-looking hyenas, looking like they stepped out of a 1920s gangster movie. The
matriarchs scowl at her, arms crossed in disappointment.]
MATRIARCH #1 (growling): What is this nonsense, cub? You’re supposed to be playing
with… with… real hyena stuff!
MATRIARCH #2 (side-eyeing HD’s fabulous Barbie doll, snorting): How are we supposed
to teach you the ways of the pack when you’re busy dressing up prey instead of eating it!?
HD (mimicking Harpo Marx, looking horrified but silent, eyes wide and mouth agape like
she’s heard the ultimate betrayal. She pulls out a fake mustache and twirls it around in
exaggerated frustration, as if she’s about to explode into a flurry of antics.)
NARRATOR (with Groucho-style snark): But HD wasn’t going down without a fight, oh no!
She was ready to make her escape. Time to get to work—cue the Looney Tunes-style planning
montage!
[Montage of HD scheming: She tiptoes around like a cartoon spy, picking locks with
exaggerated comical sound effects, before sneaking into the tourist camp. She slinks over
to the little girl from earlier, who’s sitting on a picnic blanket eating a sandwich, totally
oblivious.]
HD (gesturing wildly, trying to mime out “take me with you” like a dramatic silent film star,
waving her paws and making big puppy eyes): Soooo... umm... you got room for a new
“puppy”?
[The little girl stares at her, confused, before HD slides into the child’s lap like she’s a
fluffy little puppy. The girl shrugs and picks her up, thinking she’s just some wild
animal she can adopt.]
NARRATOR (in a rapid-fire delivery like Chico Marx in full-on "talk-fast" mode): And just
like that! HD was on her way to the Big City—Chicago! But not just any Chicago, no-no—
this was the 49th Ward, baby! The one and only Rogers Park, a land of opportunity, urban
spectacle, and weirdos!
[Cut to HD dramatically being smuggled onto a plane, barely fitting into the girl’s
carry-on bag. She’s a flurry of frantically kicking legs and paws, causing chaos and
comedic mayhem. Meanwhile, the girl’s father looks up at the overhead compartment,
eyeing the bag suspiciously.]
HD (squirming like a cartoon character trying to fit into a too-small space, finally popping
her head out of the bag and throwing her paws in the air in frustration like a silent Harpo
Marx again): Let’s get out of here, baby!
[Cut to Chicago’s streets. HD bursts out of the airport terminal, running wild in the city
like a cartoon tornado, weaving in and out of tourists and cars like it’s an action-packed
chase scene. HD’s going full diva mode, leaving a trail of chaos behind her, like a
mishmash of banana peels and confetti.]
NARRATOR (fast-talking, with slapstick comedy sounds in the background): There was a
dog catcher—a wildly exaggerated dog catcher, mind you, wearing a ridiculous outfit with a
net the size of a circus tent. He’s trying to catch our little diva, but she’s too fast! Too clever!
[HD darts and dodges, causing full-on cartoonish mayhem—sliding under trucks,
leaping over food carts, even using an umbrella to glide like a parachute. Cue
exaggerated “boing-boing” sound effects with every jump.]
NARRATOR (as the chase reaches a crescendo): And right when it seemed like all hope
was lost, she found her savior— The Glenwood! The hidden oasis of music, creativity, and
the best damn open mic this side of the Mississippi!*
[HD skids into The Glenwood, right into Nabu’s arms. Nabu, a Groucho Marx figure—
glasses sliding down, with a sarcastic wink—stares at her, immediately recognizing her
inner diva.]
NABU (in full Groucho mode, with exaggerated hand gestures): Well, well, well… what do
we have here? A lost little cub with impeccable taste? I must say, you’ve got a certain… je ne
sais quoi. You could really use some stage time, dollface.
[HD looks up at Nabu with heart-shaped eyes, struck by a Giant cartoon sparkle like
she's found her true calling. Nabu gives a smug grin, then turns dramatically to the side
as a cosmic spaceship from the Galactic Federation of Worlds (GFW) zooms past,
emitting rainbow lights and dizzying sound effects.]
NABU (suddenly deadpan and serious, like a Chico Marx turn): And this, my friend, is just
the beginning of your cosmic ascension. But before we go on about that, maybe you should
learn a little thing or two about being fabulous.
HD (giving the universal “I’m ready for whatever” hand gesture, her silent Harpo smile
growing bigger): Let’s just say... I’m already ahead of you, sugar! ! " #
[Scene ends with a full-on jazz hands routine from HD, and the screen fades to a cartoon
logo of "Hyena Diva" with sparkles and confetti.]
[Cue absurd theme music as the credits roll.]
Episode 2: "Hyena Diva Takes the Stage!"
(Inspired by the chaotic energy of Looney Tunes and the Marx Brothers, this episode dives
headfirst into the comedic mayhem of Hyena Diva’s quest to take over The Glenwood Open
Mic and establish herself as the QUEEN of Chicago’s underground arts scene.)
[Scene opens with an exaggerated Looney Tunes chase sequence. HD, still wearing the
sparkly Barbie doll outfit, slides in through the doors of The Glenwood—just as a gang
of disgruntled karaoke enthusiasts with ridiculous personalities (think angry zombie
rockstars, a mime in full makeup, and a dramatic opera singer with an oversized
bowtie) are leaving. They throw her deadpan side-eye as they shuffle out, dramatically
throwing their hands up in exasperation as they exit stage left.]
HD (standing in the middle of the empty stage, hands on her hips, dramatically flinging her
head back like a Broadway star—cue exaggerated wind sound effect):
I made it! I MADE IT! FINALLY! (Spins in place, sending sparks and confetti flying into the
air like it’s her personal New Year’s Eve party.) The Glenwood—get ready for... the Hyena
Diva Show!
[Cut to Nabu, lounging backstage with a glass of something mysterious, clearly enjoying
the spectacle, eyebrows raised with smug approval. They pull a pair of oversized, glittery
sunglasses out of nowhere and push them dramatically onto their face, like they just
stepped out of a spy movie.]
NABU (calmly sipping, raising an eyebrow in slow motion, in a deadpan Groucho Marx
voice):
Well, kid, looks like you've finally found the stage where you belong. But don't get too
comfy... tonight, we’re about to see what kind of diva you really are. (Finishes the drink with
a cartoonish exaggerated gulp, slams the glass down, and disappears backstage in a puff of
smoke—cue trapdoor sound effect.)
[Cue a whimsical jazz instrumental as HD struts to the center of the stage, eyes glittering
like diamonds, posing like an action hero preparing for a dramatic showdown. She takes
a deep breath, and—]
HD (whispering to herself, a la Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck before a big performance):
This is it. I’m about to make history.
[Suddenly, an unusual sound erupts from the back of the room. It's... the world's most
over-the-top and absurd group of open mic performers trying to set up their instruments
and act. There's a piano with a broken leg, a saxophone player in a clown wig, a
ventriloquist puppet that looks like it’s been through a few too many accidents, and a
guy in a full-body chicken suit holding a kazoo. Chaos is about to unfold.]
NARRATOR (in that classic fast-talking voice, with a flurry of slapstick sound effects):
And here we go, folks! Just when you think the stage is clear, in walks the greatest ensemble
of misfits, eccentrics, and wannabe rockstars you've ever seen! Get ready for The Glenwood
Open Mic... the place where dreams come to cluck, squeak, and break into spontaneous jazz
improv!
[The Chicken Suit Guy, strumming his kazoo loudly, interrupts HD's moment like an
overly enthusiastic toddler in a theater production.]
CHICKEN GUY (in a comically loud voice, flapping his wings):
HEY HEY HEY, I’m the next big thing! I’ll have the crowd cackling in no time!
HD (shooting him an over-the-top death glare, eyes narrowing with cartoonish laser beams,
before turning to the audience like she’s in a silly Shakespearean soliloquy):

Episode 2: "Hyena Diva Takes The Stage!"
(Inspired by the chaotic energy of Looney Tunes and the Marx Brothers, this episode sees
Hyena Diva taking her first big step into the limelight at The Glenwood Open Mic, only to
find herself surrounded by the eccentric and unpredictable mix of performers that make up
the local artistic scene.)
[Scene opens with HD, dressed in her sparkly Barbie doll outfit, dramatically tiptoeing
down a narrow, graffiti-covered alley. She’s clearly been rehearsing her big entrance
and, as she approaches The Glenwood, she pulls out a sparkling compact mirror, checks
her reflection, and lets out a slightly exaggerated gasp of approval.]
HD (to herself, looking into the mirror, Harpo Marx style, mouthing words without speaking
but making a dramatic face):
Oh yes, darling, tonight’s the night. The whole world will see what a queen looks like... in
hyena form.
[Cut to inside The Glenwood. The room is buzzing with energy as a smattering of poets,
musicians, comedians, and various eccentrics are gathered. The room is packed with
loud, theatrical personalities—comedians pacing around, poets muttering to themselves,
and one overly passionate rabble-rouser waving a “Down With the System” sign around
like a flag. There's always one person in the corner of the room who’s clearly a
loudmouth political theorist, arms flailing as they launch into an impromptu monologue
about global conspiracies and potato chips.]
NARRATOR (voiceover, fast-paced and Groucho-esque):
It’s another raucous night at The Glenwood Open Mic—a place where you might hear some
of the best poetry... or you might just get a five-minute monologue about why pigeons are
secretly government agents. Whether it’s stand-up, spoken word, or a trauma dump from a
guy who “just wants to share his feelings,” you never know what’ll happen next!
*[The crowd’s energy is a mix of exhaustion, excitement, and mild chaos. A poet finishes up
their piece, stepping down from the stage with a melancholic sigh, only to be immediately
drowned out by a guy in a flamboyant Hawaiian shirt shouting about how “the mainstream
music scene is just controlled opposition!”]
[HD, standing in the doorway, is taking all of this in with a side-eye glance of utter
confusion—the kind only a diva in the making could pull off. She steps onto the stage
with a bang, and the entire room falls into awkward silence—the good kind, the kind
where you know something special is about to happen.]
HD (striking a dramatic pose, totally unaware of what’s going on around her, flipping her
hair over her shoulder like she’s auditioning for a telenovela):
Greetings, lowly earthlings! Welcome to the stage of the most fabulous creature you’ll ever
witness! I am the Hyena Diva—and tonight, you’ll get the privilege of watching me
revolutionize the art world! (pauses for dramatic effect) You’re welcome!
[The crowd stares blankly for a moment. A tiny poet with glasses in the front row is the
first to respond, but she’s so awkward she almost drops her latte.]
POET (nervously clapping, whispering to her friend with faux intellectualism):
Wow, what a concept—the Diva of all Divas... Is this... some kind of post-postmodern
commentary on... narcissism?
[HD pauses, overanalyzing the comment for a split second, clearly not understanding
what she’s hearing, before turning back to the crowd with a massive, overly-confident
grin.]
HD (louder now, in her best diva voice):
Postmodern? Post-postmodern? Darling, I don’t do postmodern. I embody it!
[The crowd laughs nervously, unsure of whether to keep clapping or to be worried.]
[Suddenly, an overly dramatic rabble-rouser in the corner—wearing a tinfoil hat and a
sock puppet on their hand—interrupts.]
RABBLE ROUSER (holding up his puppet and shouting at the top of his lungs):
You can’t hide the truth, Hyena Diva! The CIA is using pineapple slices to control our minds!
[HD glares at the rabble rouser, completely unfazed and unimpressed, but the crowd is
eating it up like they’re at a circus sideshow. She calmly places her hands on her hips
and shakes her head slowly like she’s about to drop some wisdom.]
HD (with unmatched campy sass, flipping her hair over her shoulder):
Oh honey, if you think pineapple slices are the real problem, you clearly haven’t had a
proper cocktail in your life. I’ll let you in on a little secret: it’s not the pineapples... it’s the
energy—and I’m here to bring it! (gestures wildly around the room, as if this was some epic
battle for control of the universe)
[The room is baffled, but also intrigued. Everyone watches as HD struts around the
stage, looking like the center of a cosmic energy vortex. She cues up some dramatic
music in the background with her fancy glittery phone, and begins her wild stand-up
routine—no longer worried about the rabble rousers or poets.]
HD (tapping the mic dramatically, Groucho Marx style, with exaggerated gestures):
So there I was, a starving little hyena on the African plains, minding my own business... and
what do I find? A Barbie doll! Yes, a Barbie—the symbol of beauty, strength, and
untouchable power in the midst of the wildest wilderness. And you know what? I picked her
up and I said—this is it, this is my destiny!
[The crowd watches in amused confusion, unsure of what they’re hearing, but they’re
totally captivated. HD goes on with her exaggerated tale of becoming a diva.]
HD (with a flourish):
I was already fabulous, but this Barbie? She was my spirit animal! She knew what it meant to
be unapologetically fabulous. And that’s when I realized—this world is filled with trash, but
you don’t have to be trash—you can be the shiny, glittery, magical thing everyone else looks
up to and says “How did she do that?”
*[The crowd erupts into chaotic applause—some of them get it, some of them just want to see
where this madness goes. HD takes a deep bow, in an almost cartoonish way—completely
oblivious to the fact that she's completely derailed The Glenwood Open Mic for the night.]
NABU (backstage, in the shadows, clapping with over-the-top enthusiasm like a proud
parent):
Well, looks like the queen has spoken. But now, kid, let’s see if you can take on the real
challenge: the other eccentric artists in the room.
[Cue dramatic trumpet music as HD is left standing alone, center stage, smiling like
she’s just won a national award. The camera zooms in on her in slow motion as she
soaks in the attention, her diva persona shining bright.]
A loud, overconfident comedian (let’s call him "Rizzlord") takes the stage with an Ohio
accent so thick, you’d need a machete to cut through it. He’s in full debate-bro mode—t-shirt
that says "YOUR BODY MY CHOICE" with a sarcastic smile to match—and he’s already
cracking his knuckles like he's about to drop some “truth bombs.”
Rizzlord:
(grinning obnoxiously)
"Alright, alright, let's talk about REAL freedom, huh? The way some of these women act?
Y’all think you got choices—well, I’m here to tell you, baby, your body ain't your choice,
okay? Let me break it down for you!"
(he pauses dramatically as if waiting for applause—none comes)
"Y'know, there's a reason they say men are in charge of the world. And it's not because we
can’t handle it, ladies. Come on!"
(he winks at the audience)
HD's eyes narrow. Her ears perk up like a satellite dish locked onto a signal. She begins
pacing, her paws tapping softly as she watches this “Rizzlord” with a growing sense of
curiosity—and danger. Instincts flare. The way he talks... it’s not just annoying. There’s
something prey-like about him. But she hesitates—why? She’s never been this... unsure.
Rizzlord (spins, sensing an opportunity):
"Aw, come on, don’t get all mad, sweetie. We all know you’re just here for some attention,
huh? Can’t help yourself, right?"
HD stiffens, taking in the vibe. Her body language becomes more aggressive: shoulders
tense, claws just barely visible. She lets out a small, low growl. Her instincts are in overdrive,
but she’s still not sure whether to attack or observe.
Rizzlord (leans into the mic, totally oblivious):
"You know what they say, right? The best way to get a woman’s attention is to just... start
talkin’ to her. So let’s cut the crap—how 'bout we have a little... fun?" (He gestures
suggestively.)
"Get outta that cage, baby girl, and show me you got some... wild side in you."
At this, HD’s body language snaps. Her eyes widen, mouth snarling in disbelief. Suddenly,
Nabu’s finger twitches as they hold up their fake mic, dramatically clicking a button.
[Nabu clicks a button on their mic. A flashing graphic appears that reads:
"INAPPROPRIATE COMMENT DETECTED."]
The room goes quiet. Nabu takes a slow step forward, the air thick with tension. They
address Rizzlord in that calm, theatrical tone they always use:
Nabu: (serious, slow-paced)
“Hey, buddy... uh... did you forget where you are? Cause that ain't just weird, it’s straight-up
illegal, my friend.”
Rizzlord freezes for a second, then scoffs:
Rizzlord:
Illegal? Please, I m just speakin facts here. The only thing illegal is how much these
women—"
(he pauses as his eyes fall on HD, who's now standing completely still, eyes wide, glaring)
"Oh, hey, my bad. Didn’t know this one was a cub..."
[A sudden loud WHAM sound effect plays, as if a trapdoor has opened.]
[Nabu dramatically gestures to the side, where a neon sign flashes: “TO CATCH A
PREDATOR.”]
Nabu (smirking in Groucho-esque style):
"That’s right, pal. You just made a big oof. Now, as the mother of this wild kingdom, I'm
here to tell you something you clearly missed. The lady here—" (Nabu gestures to HD, who
is making her “What? Who me?” face, furiously pointing at herself with big, innocent eyes)
"—is a cub, my friend. A MINOR. What part of that was unclear?"
[Rizzlord’s face falls. He stutters as the crowd leans in with exaggerated gasps.]
[The camera zooms in with a loud SQUELCH sound, and the screen flashes “TO
CATCH A PREDATOR: THE HD EDITION” in big, neon rainbow letters. A giant,
flashing spotlight zooms in on Nabu, who is holding a comically oversized tablet that’s
so big, she has to squint to read it. She taps a cartoonishly oversized button, and a giant,
ridiculously long scroll of text pops up on screen, practically unrolling itself from here to
the horizon.]
Nabu (grinning maniacally, in full cartoon villain mode):
“Rizzlord... Do you think you can hide from the truth?! We’ve got your chatlog, pal! And
guess what? It’s REALLY long! Like... we’re talking Disney movie length here!”
[The audience gasps dramatically, and a looney tune-style accordion plays as the scroll
of text literally unrolls over the entire room. The text goes on and on, and then it flickers
with flashing neon signs like “WTF?!” and “SOMEBODY STOP HER!”]
Nabu (flipping her hair back like a cartoon character about to do something wild):
“Hold on to your seat, buddy, because here comes the most chaotic thing you’ve ever seen.”
(She waves the tablet like it’s an oversized weapon.)
[A giant text block appears on the screen like it’s made of bubble letters, and Nabu
starts reading aloud with extreme, overly dramatic flair—like a game show host crossed
with a Shakespearean actor.]
Nabu (reading):
“‘Girls are like IKEA furniture. Sure, you can try to assemble them with your bare hands, but
you’ll end up with extra pieces and a broken heart.’”
Rizzlord (sweating bullets, his hands trembling as he tries to avoid eye contact):
“Uh… I didn’t mean that in a bad way, I was just—”
Nabu (interrupting with a huge, cartoonish gasp and pointing a finger at him like she’s
solving a crime):
“LIES!” (Nabu turns to the screen dramatically, her finger still pointed at Rizzlord, but now
she’s holding the tablet like it’s some kind of bizarre magical scepter.)
“That’s right! The truth has been revealed!” (Nabu taps the screen and more neon flashing
words appear: “BUSTED!”)
[The chatlog starts scrolling faster and faster, each line of text more ridiculous and
completely unrelated to the situation. Quotes from famous historical figures mix with
random nonsense. Nabu reads aloud, getting more and more bewildered as the
absurdity escalates.]
Nabu (reading with increasing confusion):
“‘The only thing we have to fear is... running out of Wi-Fi.’ – Franklin D. Roosevelt. Uh, no.
That’s not right.”
[The chatlog suddenly shifts again, and now it’s showing quotes that are so out of place,
they don’t even make sense anymore. Nabu squints and reads aloud, flabbergasted.]
Nabu (reading the next entry, very puzzled):
“‘I think, therefore I am... probably going to order pizza after this.’ Wait, what is
happening?!”
[The text suddenly glitches like a bad cartoon. More random quotes flood the screen,
such as “The early bird gets the worm, but the late-night owl gets the pizza.”]
Nabu (panicking now, tapping the tablet like it’s possessed):
“NOOO! NOT MY DIARY!!” (She squints as the chatlog reveals an extra-long personal diary
entry full of her thoughts from that morning.)
Nabu (reading, trying to remain composed, but failing miserably):
“‘I woke up with a feeling that today was going to be… unusual. Also, the burrito I had last
night has definitely come back to haunt me.’ WHAT?! Who added that?!”
[The screen behind Nabu glitches again, and suddenly the chatlog starts reading out
loud her diary in a robotic voice, complete with comical sound effects like kazoo music
and horn honks.]
Robot Voice (from the chatlog):
“I had cereal for breakfast. Is cereal a metaphor for life?”
Nabu (covering her face in embarrassment, her voice cracking as she tries to stop the
chaos):
“Stop! STOP IT! I swear this is not the chatlog I meant to read, okay?!”
[Rizzlord, now visibly sweating, tries to back away slowly, tripping over a random
banana peel that just appeared in the middle of the floor. He flails dramatically as he
stumbles backwards.]
[The scene shifts abruptly to a dramatic “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”-style music,
with a giant cartoon hammer suddenly dropping from the sky onto Rizzlord’s head,
causing him to shrink and squeak like a tiny mouse. Nabu turns to the camera,
addressing the audience.]
Nabu (speaking directly to the audience, with a wink and a slap on her thigh like she’s doing
a vaudeville act):
“Oh, we’re just getting started! This is how we handle predators who think they can get away
with making weird comments. You’re in my world now, baby!”
[HD is now fully in her element, her tail wagging rapidly, her ears perking up as if she's
learning from Nabu’s leadership. She steps forward, nudging Nabu with her snout. She
lets out a little ‘Hoo-hoo-hoo!’ like a laugh, signaling her approval.]
Nabu (laughing maniacally, tossing the tablet aside):
“And just like that... you’ve been DISMISSED, RIZZLORD.” (She grabs him by the shirt and
spins him like a cartoon character, throwing him out of the scene in a wobbly, overly
exaggerated manner—like a Looney Tunes character flying out of frame with a sproing
sound effect.)
[Rizzlord is flung so hard, he crashes through the back wall, leaving a perfect silhouette
of his body in the plaster, like a classic cartoon villain.]
Nabu (grinning down at HD, who now stands proudly by her side):
“Well, cub… You saw how we handle our own. You’re part of the family now.”
[HD’s body language completely shifts—she stands taller, more confident, as though she
understands Nabu’s power and her role in the clan. She looks up at Nabu with utter
respect and admiration, letting out a sharp whoop of recognition. Her tail flicks with
excitement.]
HD *(a vocalization that’s part laugh, part war cry: *“Hoo-hoo-HOO! “)
Nabu (looking down at her with a proud smirk):
“That’s right, cub. This is our clan. And guess what? You’re next in line.” (Her voice drops
an octave, her expression growing more serious.)
“But we’ve got big problems. The Galactic Federation has been watching... and I’ve got a
feeling they’re not here for our comedy show.”
[The screen flashes with ominous symbols of the GFW—spacey symbols and cryptic
words swirling around as crazy techno music kicks in.]
Voice (echoing in the distance, ominous but playful):
“*Hyena Diva... the time is near. The secrets you seek are just beyond the stars.”
[The episode cuts to black, the credits roll with psychedelic space visuals flashing in the
background. The sound of HD’s voice echoes once more, as if the mystery is just
beginning.]
Episode 3: The Great Rizz Battle and the Galactic Faux Pas
[The episode begins with a huge explosion that looks like something straight out of a
Saturday morning cartoon, with pink and purple fireworks scattering across the sky.
The title card flashes with a giant “EPISODE 3: THE GREAT RIZZ BATTLE AND
THE GALACTIC FAUX PAS” in neon block letters, accompanied by a random horn
honk.]
[We cut to The Glenwood Open Mic, but this time, things are off the rails. The usual
lineup of comedians, poets, and musicians has turned into a giant battle royale for the
title of “Rizzmaster” (inspired by the chaotic energy of Hyena Diva’s previous
encounter with Rizzlord). The stage is decked out in absurd, over-the-top wrestlingring-style decorations and cartoonish booby traps (like rubber chickens hanging from
the ceiling). The air is electric—literally. There are sparks flying from a malfunctioning
“RIZZ-O-METER” that’s buzzing away in the corner, measuring the “RIZZ LEVELS”
of the contestants. It beeps loudly every time someone does something wildly
inappropriate or ridiculously overconfident.]
[Hyena Diva is standing in the center, taking it all in, with her tail twitching and her
ears flicking in response to the chaos. She’s fully in predator mode, ready to take on any
challenger—her gaze focused and intense. She looks over at Nabu, who is watching the
scene like a chessmaster, exuding an air of power and mystique.]
Nabu (smirking, her arms crossed as she watches the madness unfold):
“This is how you test the worth of a true Rizzlord.” (She points to a guy in a fedora who’s
holding a microphone and speaking to the audience in an over-the-top smooth voice, clearly
trying to show off his “alpha” status.)
“*But it’s about to get real messy real quick. Let’s see who can handle the Rizz Gauntlet.””
HD (letting out a complex, guttural “hoo-hoo-hoo!” noise, excited and ready for the chaos,
flicks her tail in anticipation, her eyes narrowing like a true huntress in the wild. Her body
language says “Bring it on.”)
[At this point, the “Rizz Gauntlet” triggers—the lights flash wildly, and the Rizz-o-meter
goes haywire with alarming beeps. A giant cartoon fist punches through the wall and
knocks out the contestant in the fedora with a loud “WAAH-BAM!”. The audience roars
in laughter.]
[Cut to: The “Rizz Battle” is on. Contestants are fighting for the title of Rizzmaster, but
they’re not just throwing words around—this is a physical Rizz-fight. The challenge is
simple: whoever can deliver the most “Rizz” (i.e., smooth, overconfident, ridiculous
pickup lines and wildly inappropriate comments) without getting immediately thrown out
by Nabu wins.]
Rizzlord *(from earlier, completely humiliated but somehow back from the dead—wearing a
ridiculously oversized wrestling mask and trying to reclaim his title with his “Ohio Rizz”):
“Yo, Hyena Diva, I gotta say, you look like you could fight off an army of lions. I’m a lion
too, but I don’t need no pride, I just need you in my den. I’ve got mad rizz, baby!”
[Rizzlord snaps his fingers and a dove flies out of nowhere, but the dove is wearing a
tiny tuxedo and looks completely confused.]
HD (visibly not impressed, lets out a low growl, but instead of attacking, she flicks her tail
back and forth, intrigued. She lets out a “Hoo-hoo-hoo!”—her version of a “Hmm, not bad,
but I’ve seen better.”)
Nabu (grinning from the side, watching the whole thing unfold, then turns to HD with a
wink):
“What do you think, cub? Does he have enough Rizz to handle the clan?”
*[Suddenly, the Rizz-o-meter goes haywire again, causing a giant bucket of glitter to pour
down on Rizzlord, covering him in [We open with a shaky camera shot, as if something’s
off in the air—the vibe’s uneasy. The opening is a chaotic blend of old-school TV static
and a deep, ominous hum from the Galactic Federation’s cosmic energy field.]
[The Glenwood Open Mic is in full swing, but the atmosphere is far from ordinary.
Contestants are still up on stage, but it’s clear something bigger is at play. The audience
is murmuring nervously as strange shimmers fill the air. People feel it. Something’s
coming.]
[Hyena Diva is sitting in the front row, her tail still twitching—she’s on high alert, her
natural instincts kicking in as the air feels charged—dangerously so. She shifts her gaze
to Nabu, who is standing next to her with a cold, calculating look. Something’s different
about her today. Her eyes are glowing faintly, her presence stronger than ever.]
HD (low growl, looking up at Nabu with a question in her eyes, the subtle flick of her ears
signaling something’s wrong. She knows the cosmic energy is amping up—her instincts are
warning her.)
Nabu (speaking low and deliberately, eyes flicking across the room):
“This isn’t just a Rizz battle anymore, cub. Something much darker is in motion. It’s
happening again—the harvesters are close. The Galactic Federation is watching, but there’s
something we need to stop before it escalates.” (Her voice drops, like a whisper in the night.)
[A shiver runs down the spine of the room as a figure emerges at the mic. It’s Rizzlord
—still trying to recapture his old swagger, but something’s off. His expression is glazed,
and there’s an eerie hunger in his eyes.]
Rizzlord (mumbling, as if hypnotized):
“It’s all about the ‘Rizz,’ baby. The only thing that’s real in this world... is... you know...
controlling the narrative... and harvesting the true power...” (His voice starts to fade into a
low hiss.)
[The crowd, confused, murmurs. Something about him isn’t right. He stands there,
staring at HD like he’s tracking prey, but his words sound more like a mantra.]
HD (tilts her head slightly, instinctively sizing up Rizzlord, who is now twitching erratically
—her body language shows she’s prepared to pounce, but something’s holding her back.
This feels different. She looks back at Nabu, seeking guidance.)
Nabu (eyes narrowing, her voice steady but with an undeniable hint of urgency):
“That’s not him. It’s not Rizzlord anymore. It’s them—the ones who harvest. They’ve
infiltrated, and now they’re sending their agents to this planet. He’s a vessel.”
[Suddenly, a deep, unnerving hum fills the air. The lights flicker, and the ground
beneath them seems to shift. The audience starts to murmur nervously—something is
seriously wrong.]
[Rizzlord suddenly lurches forward, throwing the mic to the ground with a sickening
thud. He looks straight at HD, his eyes now completely blank, his skin pale, almost
translucent. He opens his mouth, revealing sharp, reptilian teeth and a low, guttural
growl.]
Rizzlord (with a voice that’s not his own, hissing):
“You’re the one we need. The cub. The key to the harvest. Your essence... it’s pure, ready to
be taken. Your power... it’s what they’re looking for... and I’m just the messenger.”
[The atmosphere grows cold. The audience is paralyzed with fear. The lights flicker
violently, and the holographic projections from earlier start glitching, flashing reptilian
eyes and cryptic messages from the Galactic Federation about a “time of reckoning.”]
[Hyena Diva stands in the center of the chaos, body tensed like a predator, her tail
swishing in anticipation. But instead of launching into action, she halts, confused by the
wild, degenerate vibe coming off of Rizzlord. Her instincts flare—should she hunt or
just enjoy the shenanigans?]
HD (with a dramatic side-eye, clicking her claws—then pauses, her eyes narrowing in
irritation like she’s watching the world’s cringiest debate):
Whoooooooop!
[Rizzlord’s eyes widen—he’s clearly not processing reality. He trips over his own shoes,
crashing into the mic cord like a cartoon character, sending himself spiraling into
oblivion. His limbs flail like literal spaghetti, the sound of his body making contact with
the floor is like a meme sound effect from the dark corners of the internet—BOING!]
Nabu (glances at the wreckage, unamused, sipping her cosmic energy drink):
“Okay, this is actually the funniest thing I’ve seen in my entire 5D life. Like, is this a
deepfake? Please tell me I’m watching a TikTok skit and not reality.” (She rolls her eyes with
a smug grin.)
[Rizzlord spasms in full cartoon violence mode, spinning his head 360 degrees like a
possessed Looney Tunes character, his legs flailing like he's in a Dante’s Inferno level of
cringe. His hands slap wildly in the air like he's trying to cast a spell he doesn’t
understand. All the while, his voice sounds like a C-list meme lord trying to summon an
ancient curse, but only getting dead internet signals.]
Rizzlord *(his voice cracking and distorted like a 4chan post gone wrong):
“You think you’re safe? I’m gonna harvest the adrenochrome from your soul, you filthy
hyena. I’m the Rizzlord, baby! I WILL dominate this planet! It’s my Rizzy universe, you just
live in it!”
[His words are so disjointed, it’s as if he's been inhaling pure brain rot. He trips on the
mic stand, his body now flailing uncontrollably into a spin cycle of confusion.]
[HD stands there, watching, hypnotized by the chaos, her body snarling with
unrestrained energy. She paces back and forth like a predator in a meme factory—she’s
entertained, but also a little... confused? She’s a hyena, not a debate bro. So, instead of
launching into full attack mode, she starts making loud whooping noises, like she’s both
intrigued and mocking the situation at once.]
HD (snarling in excitement and confusion, tail flicking like a cartoon villain’s whip):
Whoo-WHOOOP! Whoop-whoop-whoop!
[The audience stares in awkward silence as the absurdity unfolds, but then—just as
Rizzlord tries to climb to his feet, thinking he’s somehow about to “take control” of the
situation—Nabu snaps her fingers. Suddenly, a cosmic portal opens, swallowing
Rizzlord up like a vacuum cleaner with a deep conspiracy agenda.]
Nabu *(eyes glowing with cosmic sass, voice dripping with meme level sarcasm):
“Oh honey, NO. That’s cute. You thought you could dominate anything? No one is escaping
the awakening, not even you. Rizzy—say goodbye to your brain rot for good.”
[Rizzlord screams in horror as he’s sucked into the portal, flailing like he’s stuck in the
Twilight Zone. His cries are warped, meme-y, like they’re edited with a Warped Tour
soundtrack—his body spinning in the air like a degenerate TikTok prank.]
Rizzlord *(distant, fading into the void like a glitchy, overused meme):
“THIS ISN’T OVER, HYENA DIVA!!! I’ll be back—just like the adrenochrome harvesting’s
gonna happen, just you wait!!!” (His voice fades into cosmic distortion.)
[HD bursts into loud, raspy laughter—completely unhinged at this point. She’s so here
for it. Her tail wags aggressively, her eyes narrowed in amusement at the cartoon chaos
she's just witnessed.]
HD *(still snickering uncontrollably, her body rocking back and forth, letting out savage
giggles):
Whoo-hoo-hoooooop!
Nabu (flipping a cosmic hand in the air like she’s wiping away a dead meme):
“Pathetic. I thought I’d seen cringe before, but this? This is next-level brain rot.” (She rubs
her forehead like she's just read an absurd conspiracy theory.)
[Suddenly, an over-the-top announcement rings out, so loud it’s almost cartoonish.]
Announcer (shouting in the style of a parody late-night TV show host):
“BREAKING NEWS: The results are in, folks! In a shockingly unbelievable turn of events,
the Rizzlord—yes, you heard it right—the RIZZLOOOOORD—is now officially alderman!
Chicago, get ready to slap into the Rizziverse!!!”
[Cut to a shameless, overacted news graphic of Rizzlord grinning from ear to ear, a bad
photoshop of him sitting in a council chair with a crown made of adrenochrome memes
—his tongue hanging out like a degenerate puppy.]
Rizzlord (speaking to the camera with complete delusion):
“That’s right, folks! You all underestimated the power of the Rizz! Now I’m running the
show, and you’ll be following my lead, or else...” (he makes a silly hand gesture as if
controlling a toy army).
[The audience erupts into a mixture of confusion and nervous giggles, unsure how to
respond to the level of absurdity they just witnessed.]
HD (eyes narrowing, lips curling into a savage grin like she’s about to snap into action):
Whoooop... WHOOP. (She looks over to Nabu, her tail flicking rapidly as she senses the call
to lead.)
Nabu (leaning back, casually sipping from her cosmic chalice with one eyebrow raised):
“*Oh, you think this is just some random nonsense? Nah, baby. This is the start of your
ascension. You’re gonna run for alderman, and we’re gonna make them all bow down.”
[The camera zooms in on HD’s face, her eyes glowing with cosmic confidence. Her tail
swishes like an apex predator, and she stands tall, exuding power. Nabu watches her
with a mix of pride and intrigue, quietly satisfied as HD steps into the role of leader.]
HD (snarling softly in her throat, a triumphant growl echoing in the air):
Whoo-hooop! (A look of total determination sets on her face. She takes a deep breath—ready
to launch her campaign.)
Cliffhanger:
As the camera pulls away, the chaotic, cosmic energy intensifies. Will Hyena Diva step into
the political ring and challenge the Rizzlord? With her new-found leadership and the power
of the Galactic Federation behind her, the battle is about to get real. The Rizzlord may have
the Rizz, but HD has the Crown—and she’s coming for Chicago’s soul.
Next time: The true battle for the city begins. Will Hyena Diva’s instincts and cosmic strength
be enough to face the forces behind the Rizzlord, or will Chicago descend into a meme-fueled
dystopia?
Episode 4: "The Hyena's Campaign: Rizzlord's Reckoning"
The episode opens with a dramatic, music-filled montage. The camera zooms in on Hyena
Diva, dressed in her best "Barbie meets Mad Max" political couture, standing on a stage
under a banner that reads: "Hyena Diva for Alderman: Change, Chaos, and Adrenochrome
for All!"
There’s a sense of excitement in the air—think circus, think chaos. A line of supporters cheer
wildly, holding signs like "Make the 49th Wild Again" and "Free the CUBs!". A giant
inflatable hyena bounces in the background, adding to the madness.
Hyena Diva (HD) stands at the podium, dramatically flipping through a stack of papers,
slamming them down like a political boss who actually knows what she's doing (but doesn't).
HD: (making exaggerated, hilarious motions with her paws as she points to various “issues”
on her list) "Look at all these issues, people! Gun violence, gentrification, and—HEY—why
are we still paying for bottled water when we got free rain, huh?!"
She slams a fist on the podium, and the crowd goes wild, even though they have no idea what
she’s talking about.
Nabu, seated in the back, gives HD an approving nod from under her large occult hood,
leaning back with a smug smile.
Meanwhile, backstage, Rizzlord, the redpilled, debate-bro comic with Ohio rizz (yes, the
same one from earlier) is prepping for the Great Political Debate of the Century. He’s hyped
up, clearly already five steps into the debate-nerd fever dream.
Rizzlord: (muttering to himself) "I’ve watched like 3.7 hours of YouTube debates on free
speech, okay? I’m ready. I know how to win this."
The camera zooms in on his messy, overly gelled hair as he stares into the mirror. A
"MAGA" hat sits next to his notes.
Cut to the Debate Stage.
HD is at the podium, Rizzlord beside her, both preparing for their showdown. The moderator
—a disinterested community member in an oversized ‘I VOTED’ shirt—looks like they’d
rather be anywhere else.
Rizzlord: (snapping his fingers) “Alright, hyena chick. Let's get this over with. I’ll take your
nonsense down, no problem. You think you’re a leader, but you’re just a cub trying to play in
the big leagues.”
HD looks at him, cocking her head to the side, making strange whooping noises with her
mouth, her gaze intense. The audience gasps.
Rizzlord: “Aww, what? You gonna bite me? Go ahead. C’mon. Get mad, little hyena. I’m
ready for your wacky animal logic.”
The camera zooms in on HD’s face as her body twitches in that way hyenas do when they’re
ready to pounce. She’s eyeing him, her predatory instincts are triggered, but she hesitates.
Hyena Divas work in packs, and she does know this is a solo gig for now.
The tension builds. She’s about to snap. The audience waits.
Suddenly, the screen flickers.
SUDDENLY...
FLASHING GRAPHICS: GFW ALERT: INTERDIMENSIONAL COMMUNICATION
LINK ESTABLISHED.
In a blink, Barbie appears on the screen, glowing like an ethereal cosmic entity in a
shimmering gown. The Galactic Federation of Worlds (GFW) symbol glows brightly in
the corner.
Barbie (via telepathic link): “My darling Hyena Diva... it’s time. Speak your truth.”
And then it happens.
HD’s voice—shocking, booming, like a lioness with a megaphone—fills the arena.
HD (now with a voice): “YOU THINK YOU CAN DISRESPECT ME? YOU THINK A
RIZZLORD IS GOING TO TALK DOWN TO ME, THE FUTURE QUEEN OF THIS
PLANET?!”
The crowd is silent. A few gasps.
Rizzlord stumbles backward. His Ohio rizz falls apart faster than his incel brain.
Rizzlord: (defensive, weirdly squeaky) “Wh-what the—? What’s happening here?! This
isn’t... This isn't right...”
HD doesn’t give him a moment to breathe.
HD (flashing teeth, gesturing wildly): “You think you can walk into my town and talk about
free speech while stripping the dignity from everyone around you? You’re the real predator,
not me, you dim-witted discourse dealer! Don’t you understand? We’re all hunting
something—we’re just not hunting each other for likes...”
Rizzlord: “No no no, that’s not what I—”
HD (cutting him off): “You know what, Rizzlord? It’s funny, because while you’ve been
running your mouth about your ‘freedoms’, you’ve actually been just a puppet for the status
quo! I mean, look at you—dressed like you’re about to sell me essential oils while telling me
how the world works!”
Nabu: (from the side, reading off a screen with a deadpan voice) “The transcripts show you
literally said: ‘I am the true alpha and I hate soy.’ No wonder your rizz is fried, buddy. Let
me read this from your private chat: ‘Bro, if I could just get her to agree with me, I’d—’ OH!
And this is from my own diary? ‘Dear Nabu, today was a big day for the movement, but
Hyena Diva stole the show!’"
The crowd is in absolute chaos. Laughter erupts.
Rizzlord: (panicking) “Wait, wait! You can’t just—there’s no way—”
HD (stepping forward aggressively, voice full of fury): “YOU THINK YOU CAN
BARGAIN WITH THE RIZZ, HUH? You wanna talk about being the top of the pack? I’m the
alpha now. And let me tell you something, Rizzlord—you’re nothing but a beta.”
The crowd is losing it. Nabu steps forward as well, cracking her knuckles like a professional
bouncer.
Nabu (to the mic): “Okay, enough. We’re gonna handle this like the GFW would handle it
—by removing the predator from our space.”
And with one swift, flawless move, Nabu kicks Rizzlord out—literally. The image freezes
on Rizzlord’s face as his body is hurled offstage in a cartoonish way, landing on his backside
with a loud “THUD!”
The scene cuts to HD, breathing heavily but standing proudly. The crowd cheers.
HD looks at Nabu, her eyes full of admiration, respect, and deep instinctual trust.
HD (in a deep, guttural voice): “Mother. Queen.”
Nabu nods, giving her a smile. "That's right, Cub. You've earned it."
Cliffhanger Ending:
The screen cuts to an ominous shot of Barbie in a glowing hologram above them, speaking
telepathically to HD.
Barbie: “Hyena Diva... the Galactic Federation of Worlds has a new mission for you.
Prepare yourself... we are ascending.”
The camera zooms in on HD’s face as she tilts her head, intrigued, ready to face whatever
cosmic challenge lies ahead.
FADE OUT.
Episode 5: "The Holy Grail of Dolls: Time-Traveling Trouble"
The episode begins in a small, cozy antique shop hidden somewhere in Rogers Park, where
Hyena Diva and Nabu are looking for something—anything—to expand the campaign. HD
is in her full diva regalia, her face alight with excitement as she browses, sniffing out
potential treasures.
HD: (pointing at a shelf) "Ooooh, that looks fancy... like, next-level-fancy, like Barbiefancy."
Nabu: (smiling, eyes scanning) "You just like shiny things, don’t you, Diva?"
Nabu walks toward a glass display case and stops. There it is.
A Bild Lili doll, the original—pre-Barbie, the Grail of dolls. It glints under the dim light,
almost glowing with a supernatural aura.
HD: "What is this? A weird Barbie prototype?"
Nabu: (eyes widening) "No, no way... that’s it. That’s the one. The Holy Grail of doll
history."
Nabu goes for the case, fingers trembling as she unlocks it.
Nabu (whispering): "It’s her... Bild Lili... the doll that started it all."
Nabu holds the doll up, reverently, like she's holding the most powerful artifact in the
universe. HD, ever the curious creature, steps closer.
Without thinking, HD places her paw on the doll’s porcelain arm, and suddenly—the air
shifts. A crackling, electric noise fills the room.
The screen goes blank for a moment, and when it flickers back to life—everything is
different. They’re no longer in the shop.
They stand in the center of a bustling 1950s-style cartoon world. The streets are lined with
shops with excessively manicured, cartoonish signs. The people are drawn with exaggerated
features, all big heads and tiny bodies, walking on long, comically stiff legs. It's a Bild Lilistyle world—and everything looks like it came straight out of a vintage German comic strip.
Nabu (frozen in place): "This... this is not possible. We... we’re inside the cartoon."
HD: (sniffing the air and whooping excitedly) "So, this is what time travel smells like..."
Suddenly, the cartoon Bild Lili appears in front of them—a perfectly coiffed, hyperglamorous version of HD with exaggerated high heels, a tight dress, and a bubble-head
posture. Her lips are impossibly plump, her eyes wide and fluttering, giving off the air of
someone who's completely aware of her looks and how much power they wield.
Cartoon Bild Lili: (with a mockingly sweet voice) "Oh, hello there! I don’t think we’ve met
before... sigh... so many suitors..."
Lili’s suitors appear—multiple versions of Rizzlord—but drawn in strange and exaggerated
forms. One is dressed in a clown suit, the other in a tuxedo made entirely out of dollar bills,
and a third in full medieval armor, wielding a sword made out of a giant slice of pizza.
Rizzlord 1: (bowing) “My lady, I’ve got 200 IQ points—I can talk about freedom and
finance all day.”
Rizzlord 2: (waving a wad of cash) “And I’ll make sure your independence is fully funded,
doll. You want a gold-plated vacation? I’ll buy you a continent.”
Rizzlord 3: (holding up a pizza) “Nothing says independence like pizza, right? It’s just like
freedom, but with extra cheese.”
The screen cuts between the three, as they all surround Cartoon Bild Lili, vying for her
attention. Lili, in turn, looks completely uninterested, leaning back on a lounge chair, as if
none of them could possibly comprehend the world she lives in.
Nabu: “This is exactly what they thought women were... back then... a joke. Just things to be
fought over, with no ambition, no intelligence. Just... gold-diggers.”
HD: (snarling) "Gross." She steps forward, her instinct to protect her space and her identity
surfacing. "This is not how we operate."
Nabu (holding her back): "Wait. This... This is important. Let me show you something."
Nabu gestures to Cartoon Bild Lili again, who is still sitting there, calmly brushing her hair.
Nabu: “You see, Bild Lili wasn’t just a ‘gold-digger’ stereotype. She was financially
independent. In fact, she was strategic—she was all about the game, about making her own
choices, never caught in a compromising situation.”
HD: (her head tilting) "She got a plan?!"
Nabu: “Yes. Strategic. She didn’t need a man to dictate her success. But they turned her into
a punchline—a symbol of the negative stuff. She was a reflection of what men thought of
independent women, a warped view of how they could exist in a modern world.”
The scene shifts, now moving into a flashback montage, showing the evolution of Lili to
Barbie. We see Barbie in her early days—bathing suit clad, driving a convertible,
surrounded by men and women alike, but all of them treating her as frivolous, empty-headed,
a trinket.
Nabu: "Then Barbie came along... and she evolved—she was a career woman, made her own
money, got educated, and became inclusive. But all they saw was airhead. She faced the
same negative connotations as Lili—except Barbie took control of that narrative and turned it
into a force for good.”
The episode’s tone turns suddenly dark. The Rizzlords now appear as caricatures of the
modern-day debate bros, standing in front of the screen, holding up signs that say:
• "Women Just Want Free Stuff!"
• "Modern Women Are Out of Control!"
• "If You Want Equality, Prove You Can Serve!"
Their voices echo, overly dramatic.
Rizzlord 1: “Modern women, huh? All these girls think they’re Lili... but no—that’s not how
it works! They’re just looking for a sugar daddy.”
Rizzlord 2: “No woman can be independent without a man’s help!”
Rizzlord 3: “Tell me, modern women, when was the last time you actually contributed to
society?”
HD: (snarling, her body low and tense) "You think you can control me like that?"
Nabu (whispering): “This... this is it. You see what they’re doing? They’re trapping women
in this endless cycle of stereotypes. But you, Hyena Diva—you’ve got the tools to break it.
You’re not Lili, and you’re certainly not Barbie—you’re both and more.”
The camera zooms in on HD’s eyes. For a moment, there's a flash of brilliance, and the GFW
symbol gleams over her shoulder.
She steps forward, snarling with the power of both Lili and Barbie, ready to dismantle the
Rizzlords and their toxic narrative once and for all.
HD (with a growl): “I’m not a gimmick. And you’re not my suitor. You’re a joke.”
The scene shifts back to the real world, as the two snap back into the antique shop, the Bild
Lili doll still in Nabu's hands.
HD (panting, wild-eyed): “Did you see that?! We... we were in history! I was Lili... then I
was Barbie... and I didn’t let them win! I was me!”
Nabu (grinning, wise as ever): “And that’s why you’ll win this fight, Diva. Now let’s get
back to your campaign, the real one.”
HD (seriously, staring ahead): "I’ve got work to do... and no rizzlord can stop me."
Cliffhanger Ending:
The camera zooms out to show the GFW symbol, its light dimming, as a new shadow
approaches on the horizon—a shadow that belongs to someone who’s been watching... and
listening.
The stage is set for the next great battle.

Episode 5: "The Holy Grail of Dolls: Time-Traveling Trouble (Part 2)"
The episode begins with a quick recap—Hyena Diva and Nabu now find themselves inside
the world of a 1950s-style cartoon, after HD accidentally touched the original Bild Lili doll,
the precursor to Barbie. The moment shifts from comedy to deeper reflection, as Nabu begins
to explain the true origins of Bild Lili, and what it means for both her and HD.
Nabu: "You see, Diva, what the world got wrong about Lili—and what they still get wrong
about Barbie—is the idea that they were ‘objects’ of men’s desires. Lili was never just there
to be flirted with, or to entertain men. In fact, she never even encouraged men’s flirtations!
She just existed as her own person, doing her own thing. Lili was about power,
independence, and making decisions on her terms, not being manipulated by anyone."
HD: "Wait, so... Lili was never into the dudes? She just stood there with her own goals?"
Nabu: "Exactly! Lili wasn't designed to be sexy for a man. She was designed to be a
character, a woman who didn’t need a partner to define her. She wasn’t looking for a
‘husband’ or a ‘suitor’—she just wanted to live her life."
HD (thinking): "Okay, so... Lili was, like... this bad-ss independent queen, before it was
even a thing?"
Nabu: "Exactly."
The scene shifts to a flashback sequence, with Bild Lili moving through a world full of
exaggerated characters—her suitors included. But instead of engaging with them, she brushes
them off, uninterested and unapologetic. The men are portrayed as cartoonish, onedimensional characters who only think they want her, but she’s not buying it.
As the flashback continues, we transition into Barbie’s world: The bright, pastel world
where Barbie first emerges. It’s a bubblegum-colored dreamland, full of career opportunities,
vacations, and fun adventures. But in this world, Barbie faces assumptions. People assume
Barbie is just a model, a walking fashion show, or an airhead who can’t hold a job or
have ambitions.
Nabu: "Now Barbie—she took that image and flipped it on its head. She made herself a
doctor, a scientist, a teacher, a businesswoman, and even a presidential candidate. But the
world just saw her as a ‘bubblehead’—someone too perfect to be taken seriously."
HD (snarling): "They turned her into a cartoon of herself, just like they did with Lili!"
Nabu (nodding): "Exactly. And when Barbie became an icon, they expected her to be
defined by her relationships. They wanted her to be attached to Ken, like he was her sole
purpose in life."
Cut to: The Cartoon Version of Barbie and Ken in a living room, both in exaggerated,
colorful poses. Barbie lounges on a couch, a magazine in hand. Ken is standing next to her,
his arm casually draped over her shoulder. It’s the perfect couple—except, there’s no
romantic tension. Barbie is just chilling.
Ken (smiling warmly): "So... have you thought about getting married, Barbie?"
Barbie (smiling back, not taking her eyes off her magazine): "Well, Ken... I’m more
focused on my next big project. I’ve got work to do, you know?"
Ken (casually): "Yeah, I know. I’ve got my own thing going, too. So, no pressure."
Narrator (voiceover): "Despite all the pressure the world put on Barbie to ‘settle down’ and
marry Ken, Barbie was too busy with her friends and her career to even think about it."
Nabu (grinning): "You see, Barbie never needed Ken. She needed herself, her friends, and
her work. And Ken understood that. True allies, right there."
HD (growing agitated): "Why does everyone think Barbie and Ken are just about each
other? They had other things going on—Ken had his own achievements!"
Nabu (holding up a finger): "Exactly! That’s the point—Ken knew who he was. He didn’t
need to compete with Barbie. He had his own goals and his own sense of self-worth. Ken
wasn’t just some accessory."
HD (snapping): "So, he was actually Kenough?!"
Nabu: "Yes! Ken wasn’t interested in competing with Barbie. He was a partner, not a
sidekick. A full person, who didn t need validation from anyone, even Barbie. He had his
own career and achievements—plenty of them."
Flash to a moment where Ken, in the cartoon, holds up a certificate—a degree in
Engineering, with his name written in bold letters. Next to it is another certificate: Ken's
Accomplishments in Self-Discovery. He doesn't need a degree in a high-paying field; he’s
happy to support Barbie’s journey while building his own. The camera pulls back, showing
him teaching a class on architecture in a high school while Barbie is off conquering the
world. Ken’s life isn’t a competition, it’s just another adventure.
Nabu: "Ken was never just a prop. He didn’t need to prove himself. He was Ken—he had
everything he needed to be confident and self-assured."
HD (picking up on it): "So Ken wasn’t just some simp for Barbie—he was his own person,
doing his own thing?"
Nabu: "Exactly. Ken knew that real strength comes from embracing your own identity. No
one has to live in the shadow of the other."
The screen then flashes back to the present day, where Rizzlord and his posse of
questionable characters are making their usual absurd comments about “modern women.”
Rizzlord 1: “You know, Barbie could’ve had everything—if only she’d stayed with Ken. I
mean, who else would’ve helped her build her empire?”
Rizzlord 2: “Oh, you mean a real man would’ve taken her off the career track and kept her
in a ‘traditional’ role?”
Rizzlord 3 (smug): “If Barbie had known what real masculinity was, she’d have settled
down with Ken and called it a day. I mean, what’s a woman without a man?”
HD (standing tall, her voice growing darker): “What’s a woman without a man? Well,
that’s exactly what I’m about to show you.” (She steps forward.)
Nabu: "You’ve got it, Diva. Ken knew what was up—and now you do too. The world’s been
confused about what defines a man and a woman for far too long. And you, Hyena Diva,
have the answer: you don’t need to fit in their box. You make your own rules."
The camera zooms in on HD’s eyes, full of fire as she steps to the front of the debate stage,
ready to face Rizzlord once and for all.
But then—a sudden flash of light.
Cliffhanger:
The GFW symbol flashes brightly, and the screen glitches again, pulling us back to the real
world, where Ken, in the distance, watches from the shadows. He steps forward, a serious
look on his face. No longer just the accessory, but now the guardian of his own narrative.
Ken (murmuring, almost to himself): “They don’t get it yet. I’m Kenough. Just wait.”
TO BE CONTINUED...
Episode 6: "Kenough: The Unlikely Hero"
The scene picks up from the cliffhanger—Hyena Diva stands at the front of the debate stage,
her eyes glowing with fierce determination. She can feel the GFW energy surging through
her, the presence of something beyond this world, and it’s guiding her. But just as the
spotlight is on her, there's a sudden ripple in reality, and a flash of light splits the air.
Nabu is by her side, hand outstretched as she tries to steady herself, but there's a swirling
distortion, as if time itself is twisting. Then—BOOM—the air goes still.
The camera zooms out to reveal Ken, standing in the back corner of the room, still under the
soft glow of the stage lights. He’s not wearing his usual laid-back grin. There’s seriousness
in his eyes as he looks at the chaotic situation unfolding before him. He steps forward, his
steps echoing through the quiet room like a marching drumbeat.
Ken (firmly): "Enough of this nonsense."
Rizzlord, still spewing his nonsense, doesn’t seem to notice the shift in energy. He continues
his ranting, trying to dunk on Hyena Diva with more ridiculous takes on "modern women"
and "simp culture." He’s still going for the cheap laughs, but the crowd isn’t buying it.
Rizzlord (mockingly): "I mean, this whole thing's just a circus, right? It's all about playing
the game. Like, what's a woman in today’s world without a man who knows what’s up? I’m
just sayin’, you can’t have everything... unless you’ve got a real man to back you up, like
me!"
Nabu steps up next to HD, smirking at the increasingly uncomfortable atmosphere.
Nabu (with a sly grin): “Are you really going to say that? You think this is the game?
You’re getting played, my dude. You’ve been drinking too much of your own delusional
Kool-Aid.”
The audience starts to murmur, some cheering for Nabu’s sharp tongue. Hyena Diva takes a
deep breath, feeling the tension build, and she knows it’s her time. Her instinct kicks in.
HD stands a little taller, and the GFW emblem flashes brightly once again. A sudden
surge of power pulses through her. Her eyes flash with the knowledge she’s received. She’s
ready. But just as she steps forward to speak, the unimaginable happens—Hyena Diva
opens her mouth and… SHE SPEAKS.
HD (with a voice that’s powerful, but wild): “You don’t get it, do you? I’m not here for
your outdated ‘man-woman’ binary. I’m here to shift the whole paradigm. You—and all of
your pathetic, outdated beliefs about power dynamics—are just a product of a time gone by.
You think you’re special just because you talk big? Honey, I’m not just some glorified
accessory to your fragile masculinity. I am the future!”
The crowd goes silent. Rizzlord’s smugness falters. The shift from silence to aggressive
presence is palpable. It’s clear—Hyena Diva isn’t just a character. She’s now a force to be
reckoned with.
Rizzlord (taken aback): “Uh... okay, wow, I—"
But Hyena Diva doesn’t give him a moment to recover. She strides confidently across the
stage, her fierce energy compelling everyone in the room to watch her every move. She turns
to the audience, making eye contact with each and every person, her voice echoing.
HD (boldly, still walking): “The problem is simple—you’re stuck in the past. But Barbie
and I? We’ve been about the future since the start. You talk about women needing a ‘man’ to
have value, but look at Barbie. She built everything—and she never married Ken! It’s not
about choosing the right man. It’s about choosing YOURSELF.”
Suddenly, as she walks, the lights flicker, and the GFW emblem glows even brighter
behind her. A deep rumble shakes the stage. Rizzlord’s face twitches as he realizes
something’s happening. This isn’t just a debate. This is a cosmic shift.
Rizzlord (in a daze): “Wait—what the hell just happened? You weren’t... You can’t be
serious. Barbie’s... she wasn’t—"
Nabu (leaning in, her voice low but full of conviction): “What you don’t understand is that
Barbie wasn’t ‘owned’ by Ken—she wasn’t a ‘thing’ for him to control. She’s always been
about freedom—freedom to create, freedom to become whoever she damn well pleases. She
didn’t need a ‘Ken’ to be complete, and neither does Hyena Diva."
Suddenly, Hyena Diva steps up to Rizzlord, her voice rising, her presence intimidating, yet
irresistibly charismatic.
HD (snarling, smiling fiercely): “And you—you’re not the one in charge anymore. Your
pathetic little platform? Dead. You thought you could keep men in a box? You thought you
could keep women in a box? Too bad. This is the new world order—Barbie, Lili, and now
me—we’re the ones who make the rules.”
The crowd erupts in a mix of gasps, applause, and shock. Rizzlord stumbles back, barely
able to comprehend what just happened.
Ken, from the back of the room, watches this all unfold. There’s a moment of clarity in his
eyes. It’s not that he was weak or passive. He wasn’t just Barbie’s sidekick. Ken has always
been strong—but he didn’t need to prove it. He was the rock that supported Barbie’s rise.
And now, as he watches Hyena Diva do what she does best, he knows his time is coming.
There’s a revolution brewing.
Nabu (smirking): “You know, Rizzlord, you might want to start thinking about what the
future looks like. Because in case you haven’t figured it out yet, the game has changed.”
As Rizzlord stumbles offstage, Hyena Diva stands victorious, her victory speech practically
seismic in its intensity. The audience is now completely captivated by her.
HD (taking a deep breath, looking out over the audience): "And you wanna know the best
part? We didn't need a man to make it happen."
The lights dim, the GFW emblem pulsates, and as the camera pulls back, we see Ken,
quietly nodding in agreement.
Ken (whispering to himself): “I’ve always known my place. But now... it’s time for
everyone to realize theirs.”
CUT TO BLACK.
Episode 7: "Kenergy: Reclaiming the Alpha"
The episode opens with Hyena Diva standing tall, looking out over a vibrant cityscape. The
GFW emblem pulses faintly in the background, and the camera zooms in on her face, filled
with determination.
A soft wind picks up, tousling her hair, but she’s unbothered. The sounds of the city grow
fainter as the camera lingers on her eyes, filled with purpose.
Hyena Diva (voice-over): "For years, society’s been telling men what they can’t be. They
say it’s all about ‘alpha’ or ‘beta’—and don’t even get me started on the ‘incels.’ They’ve
been left in the dark, with no direction, no purpose… and no Kenergy."
Cut to Rizzlord, still recovering from the last episode’s chaos, slumped in his basement,
surrounded by "red pill" books and endless stacks of YouTube conspiracy videos. His face
is twisted with frustration. He’s finally facing the truth: he’s been part of the problem. His
incoherent rants on masculinity have only deepened the incel epidemic, leaving him feeling
more and more lost.
Rizzlord (muttering to himself): "I… I need to find the answer. What is this world? Why
can’t I be like them? They all have it figured out. The alphas. The alphas... Why can’t I just
—"
Cut to Hyena Diva on stage at a packed rally. Nabu stands behind her, glowing like a
mystical figure, as HD takes the mic, her confidence radiating. She’s ready to take on the
incoherent rants of the “incel army” and give them something they’ve never had—
Kenergy.
Hyena Diva (roaring into the mic): "Listen up, you lost boys of the ‘red pill’ cult! You
think you’ve been abandoned, that women are out here sucking the life out of you? Well,
guess what? The real problem is—you’ve forgotten how to BE a man!"
The crowd’s energy booms—half in confusion, half in excitement. HD continues her fiery
speech, her voice powerful, yet mysteriously playful.
Hyena Diva (playfully, but forcefully): "You think you're men because you take the ‘alpha’
title, but true strength isn’t about being some lone wolf. It’s about the pack, the tribe, the clan
—and let me tell you something, Ken here didn’t get to where he is by pretending to be the
lone ‘alpha male.’ He got there by knowing his worth, knowing his place, and being okay
with that. That, my friend, is Kenergy."
Cut to Ken standing in the back of the crowd, his trademark laid-back charm replaced by a
newfound strength in his posture. He’s listening carefully, his eyes locked on Hyena Diva.
Ken (smirking to himself): “Finally, someone gets it.”
The scene shifts to a dimly lit room, where a group of incels are gathered, watching a live
stream of Hyena Diva’s speech. Their expressionless faces show signs of boredom, but as
her words echo through the speakers, something clicks in their minds. Their fingers pause
mid-scroll. One of them, Chet, the stereotypical ringleader, leans forward.
Chet (confused but intrigued): "Wait, what did she just say? Kenergy? Who is this chick?
She sounds... different."
Suddenly, Rizzlord bursts into the room, looking absolutely frantic, his eyes wide with
panic.
Rizzlord (panicking): "No! No, no, no! She can’t be right! This is a trap! She’s rewriting
everything! She can’t say these things! She’s trying to take our power!"
But Chet, normally the loudest, just sits there quietly, his fingers tapping against the desk.
He’s thinking, for the first time, really thinking.
Chet (quietly): "What if she’s right? What if… what if we’ve been fighting the wrong fight
all along?"
Cut back to the rally, where Hyena Diva is leading the crowd in a chant. Her voice is
infectious, the crowd chanting right along with her. She’s been sowing the seeds of Kenergy
—the true power of a man who knows his place and has no need to dominate or control
anyone to prove his worth.
Hyena Diva (shouting): "It’s time to stop pretending we’re enemies. It’s time to join forces,
to stop fighting each other for the scraps. We rise together—because when Ken knows he’s
Kenough, there’s no competition. We are ALL enough!"
The crowd erupts into applause. Rizzlord, still watching from his basement, is having a
mini-breakdown. The incels around him look at each other with a mix of awe and confusion.
Rizzlord (screaming): "No! This is wrong! She’s turning the tide! This is MY fight! MY
truth!"
Nabu steps forward, her voice soft but sharp, like a blade of light cutting through the
darkness.
Nabu (to the camera): "It’s not about proving who’s better. It’s about knowing who you
are—and owning that. You think this world is run by men in suits trying to control
everything? Nah. It’s run by those who are confident in who they are—without pretending to
be something they’re not. That’s Kenergy. And it’s time we all reclaim it."
The screen flashes, and suddenly, a lightning bolt strikes the stage. The GFW emblem
pulsates once again. The tension in the air is electric.
Hyena Diva (grinning): "You think you can silence us? You think you can tell us what it
means to be a man? Think again. You don’t own Kenergy. We do."
The crowd explodes in thunderous applause. Rizzlord’s face drops.
Rizzlord (defeated, shouting): "This can’t be happening! No, no, no, no, no—"
Chet, the quiet one, stands up and walks toward the screen, staring at Hyena Diva with
newfound clarity.
Chet (grinning): "Maybe it’s time we find our own Kenergy."
The camera zooms in on Ken, smiling confidently. There’s no arrogance, just a quiet power
in his smile. He turns toward the crowd, raising his fist in the air.
Ken (with a sense of calm authority): “Kenough.”
CUT TO BLACK.
